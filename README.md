# Workout-tracker

In order to get good results in any field of life we need to track the progress. In gym culture we track progress by many factors such as muscle growth, endurance, strength etc based on personal goals.
But every thing is tracked by how much an indivisual is doing in their workou session and in order to grow muscles we all have to use the fundamental "Progressive Overlading" technique.
With this appliction we track the workout, the weight we used, the rpetions we did from the last workout so that we can increase the weight or reps per set to aplly the Progressive Overloading removing the need to remeber everyting.
